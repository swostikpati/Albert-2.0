# Albert 2.0

## Project Description

New York University has a widely known student information website known as NYU Albert (named after its founder Albert Gallatin). The website is critical to several administrative functions including admissions, course enrollment, etc. and is linked to the database storing the information of every person affliated to the institution. My project was an attempt at creating a revamped version of the website, with modern UI designs, an easier user flow, etc. to enhance the overall user experience.

### Overview

### Inspiration and Target Audience

NYU Albert is a really important and a widely used website by those affliated to the university. It stores a lot of user data including courses, grades, transcripts, course reviews, finances, etc. for students. But even while being such an important tool, the website as a whole is very obsolete and provides a pretty bad user experience. It is much different from the regular NYU websites providing information to the general public which have much better UI elements.

From a personal experience of things, I have suffered a lot during course registration in NYU Albert. The way the website is designed, makes the process much more complicated than it needs to be and makes the experience of course registration much more stressful. I conducted a user research where I asked students to fill out a completely anonymous form sharing their experience with the website - what they liked, what they disliked, and any feedback that could help with the overall improvement of the website. This is the link to the survey [results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G2sTYKrhQmre93UE4gNCocgiv6ZYQ7TteUVa0LzOiW8/edit?usp=sharing). Overall the feedback I received also focussed a lot on the issues I mentioned above especially concerning course registration.

Taking away from all these reponses and my personal experience, I knew a Version 2 of the website was extremely necessary. This is what inspired me to take this up as my final project. 

### Concept

NYU Albert is a huge website with a lot of applications and loads of user data. It is very difficult to clone the entire web application and develop it at the same time. For this reason, I thought of focussing on improving a single important functionality. For the purpose of the project, I chose to improve elements of the process of course registration to make it much less stressful. The project doesn't have the actual course enrollment part implemented, but rather focusses more on the steps that lead up to the registration.
